#Quiz
Making a simple quiz game inspired by [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/quizzes).

Implement twitter, flickr and facebook API.
Those APIs are used in index.js
index.js is driven by node.js
Once APIs get data, it'll be implemented in tmplProject.html
To user, just access to ./quiz

The page which I made as a mockup is also accessible.
access to ./project.html
